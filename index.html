Nothing, nothing, nothing, look tell her destiny has brought you together, (George takes out a pad of paper and begins to write this all down.)…tell her that she's the most beautiful you have ever seen. Girls like that stuff. What, what are you doing George? I'm writing this down, this is good stuff. Yeah okay. About how far ahead are you going? About 30 years, it's a nice round number. Look me up when you get there, guess I'll be about 47. I will. Take care.</p>
